# dock-demo

## Install denpendencies

```
yarn
```

## Run Demo

```
node demo.js
```

## Our Workflow

1. build a unsigned txn (all txn information is passed by parameters)
2. sign the unsignedTx with sender privateKey

## Our Needs

1. help us find the reason why the signed transaction cannot be broadcast to the dock blockchain?
2. how we can fix itï¼Ÿ give us a demo(offline) that would be best.

## Thanks!!!
